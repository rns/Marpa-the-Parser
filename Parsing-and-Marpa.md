Parsing and Marpa
-----------------

Let us define [parsing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) as a way to convert input (source) to output (target) according to grammar.

To sound proverbially, if all you have is a parser, then everything is a language. Proverbial bias notwithstanding, in a world organized around languages, where one language's semantics is another language's syntax, parser(s) (per the above definition) can be all you need.

With Marpa, it means that [The Interpreter Design Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern), once called [a sort of practical joke](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/ten-great-books) can now [be practically used](http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/03/interpreter.html).
